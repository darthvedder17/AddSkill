# Stack based solution that enumerated forward and compares the top element of the stack with the current element v ,
    # If the top element in the stack is smaller we pop the top element and difference of the (current Index): i  and the index where (temperature has risen) : temp are calculated.
    # Otherwise default value 0 is set
